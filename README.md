## 📦 Building for Android

### Automated Builds (GitHub Actions)

APK builds are automatically created when code is pushed to the `master` branch via GitHub Actions. The built APK can be downloaded from your [Expo builds page](https://expo.dev).

**Setup Required**: Add an `EXPO_TOKEN` secret to your GitHub repository. See [.github/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md](./.github/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md) for complete setup instructions.

### Manual Builds (Local)

To build a standalone Android APK or AAB manually:

1. **Install EAS CLI**

   ```bash
   npm install -g eas-cli
   ```

2. **Configure EAS**

   ```bash
   eas login
   eas build:configure
   ```

3. **Build APK** (for testing/distribution outside Play Store)

   ```bash
   eas build --platform android --profile preview
   ```

4. **Build AAB** (for Google Play Store)
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android --profile production
   ```

For detailed build instructions, see [ANDROID_BUILD.md](./ANDROID_BUILD.md)

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Code Style

- **TypeScript Strict Mode** enabled - all strict checks enforced
- **Single quotes** for strings
- **Semicolons required**
- **2-space indentation**
- **80 character line width**
- Use path aliases: `@/*`, `@components/*`, `@screens/*`, `@models/*`, `@utils/*`

### Git Workflow

- **Pre-commit hooks** automatically run linting and formatting
- **Husky** enforces code quality at commit time
- Always run `npm run check-all` before committing

### Best Practices

- Use explicit types for function parameters
- Avoid `any` type - use proper types or `unknown`
- Prefix unused variables with underscore: `_unusedVar`
- Use `StyleSheet.create()` for all styles
- Follow React Hooks rules
