## Development Workflow

### Setup and Installation

```bash
npm install              # Install dependencies
npm run prepare          # Set up Husky git hooks
```

### Running the App

```bash
npm run android          # Run on Android device/emulator (preferred)
npm run web              # Run in web browser (localhost:8081)
npm run ios              # Run on iOS device/simulator
npm start                # Start Expo dev server
```

### Code Quality Commands

```bash
npm run lint             # Run ESLint on all files
npm run lint:fix         # Auto-fix ESLint issues
npm run lint:errors      # Show only critical errors (no warnings)
npm run format           # Format all files with Prettier
npm run format:check     # Check formatting without making changes
npm run type-check       # Run TypeScript type checking
npm run check-all        # Run all checks (type-check, lint, format-check)
```

### Building

```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview    # Build APK for testing
eas build --platform android --profile production # Build AAB for Play Store
```

See `ANDROID_BUILD.md` for detailed Android build instructions using EAS CLI.

**Note**: Builds happen on Expo servers, not locally. GitHub Actions automates this for `master` branch.

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- **Strict mode enabled** - all TypeScript strict checks are enforced
- Use explicit types for function parameters and complex return types
- Avoid `any` type (warning level) - use proper types or `unknown`
- Prefix unused variables with underscore: `_unusedVar`
- Use path aliases:
  - `@/*` for `src/*`
  - `@components/*` for `src/components/*`
  - `@screens/*` for `src/screens/*`
  - `@models/*` for `src/models/*`
  - `@utils/*` for `src/utils/*`

### React & React Native

- **No PropTypes** - use TypeScript interfaces for prop validation
- **React 19** - React import not required in JSX files
- Follow React Hooks rules (enforced by eslint)
- Avoid inline styles (warning level) - use StyleSheet.create()
- Avoid color literals (warning level) - define colors in theme
- Use proper platform-specific components when needed

### Code Style (Prettier)

- **Single quotes** for strings
- **Semicolons required**
- **2-space indentation**
- **80 character line width**
- **Trailing commas** in ES5 compatible locations
- **LF line endings**
- Arrow function parens: avoid when single parameter

### Git Workflow

- **Pre-commit hooks** automatically run linting and formatting on staged files
- Ensure all checks pass before committing
- Husky enforces code quality at commit time

### Dependency Management

**Adding Dependencies:**

- Use `npm install <package>` for regular dependencies
- Use `npm install -D <package>` for dev dependencies
- **Always check Expo compatibility** before adding native modules
- For React Native libraries, verify they work with React Native 0.81.5
- Consider bundle size impact on mobile app

**Common Dependencies:**

- React Navigation - already included, use for routing
- AsyncStorage - already included, use for storage
- Expo modules - prefer Expo equivalents over bare React Native
- Vector icons - use built-in Expo icon sets

**Updating Dependencies:**

- Test thoroughly after updates, especially for React Native/Expo
- Follow Expo SDK upgrade guides for major version bumps
- Update package-lock.json by running `npm install`

## Key Conventions

### Component Organization

- Screen components go in `src/screens/{feature}/`
- Reusable components go in `src/components/common/`
- Base/abstract components go in `src/components/screens/`
- Export components from `src/components/index.ts` for cleaner imports

### Navigation

- Navigation types defined in `src/navigation/types.ts`
- Uses drawer navigator for main screens
- Uses stack navigator for detail/form screens
- Dark theme applied consistently across navigation

### State Management

- AsyncStorage for data persistence
- Character, Faction, Location, and Event data stored locally
- Storage utilities in `src/utils/characterStorage.ts`
- Import/Export functionality in `src/utils/exportImport.ts`

### Styling

- Dark theme with consistent color palette:
  - Primary: `#6C5CE7` (purple)
  - Background: `#0F0F23` (dark blue)
  - Card: `#262647` (lighter dark blue)
  - Border: `#404066` (gray-blue)
- Use StyleSheet.create() for all styles
- Avoid inline styles and color literals when possible

## Files to NOT Modify

- `node_modules/` - Dependencies (automatically managed)
- `.expo/` - Expo build cache
- `dist/`, `build/` - Build outputs
- `.husky/` - Git hooks configuration (unless specifically working on git hooks)
- Config files unless specifically required for the task:
  - `babel.config.js`
  - `metro.config.js`
  - `tsconfig.json`
  - `eslint.config.js`
  - `.prettierrc`
- CSV test files (`test-factions*.csv`) - used for testing import functionality

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions

- **Automated APK builds** trigger on pushes to `master` branch
- Workflow uses Expo EAS to build Android APK
- Build takes ~10-20 minutes on EAS servers
- APK download URL posted to GitHub Releases
- See `.github/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md` for setup details

### Build Verification

- Ensure `app.json` and `eas.json` remain valid
- Don't modify GitHub Actions workflow without testing
- Build errors usually indicate dependency or configuration issues

## Testing & Validation

- **No test framework currently configured** - manual testing required
- Test on Android device/emulator primarily
- Web version may have limited functionality
- Always run `npm run check-all` before committing
- Verify changes with `npm run android` or `npm run web`

### Manual Testing Checklist

When making changes, test:

- Character CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Faction membership sync (changes reflect in both characters and factions)
- Location coordinate handling
- Event timeline ordering
- Import/Export functionality (JSON, CSV, ZIP)
- Navigation between screens
- Data persistence after app restart

## Important Notes

### Data Structure

- Characters have detailed stats, skills, and relationships
- Factions track members and character affiliations
- Locations can have coordinates for map display
- Events form a timeline with date tracking

### Performance Considerations

- Large character lists may need pagination (not yet implemented)
- Image handling uses Expo Image Picker
- Export/Import uses CSV and JSON formats
- AsyncStorage is used for all data persistence (has size limitations)

### Known Limitations

- No automated tests currently
- Web platform may have reduced functionality
- Export/import feature needs manual testing
- Some TypeScript strict mode errors exist (being addressed incrementally)

## Security Considerations

### Secrets Management

- **Never commit secrets** to source code
- GitHub integration uses tokens stored securely
- `EXPO_TOKEN` is stored in GitHub Secrets for CI/CD
- Users manage their own GitHub tokens in-app

### Data Privacy

- All data stored locally on device (AsyncStorage)
- No telemetry or analytics collection
- GitHub integration is opt-in only
- Export functions should not expose sensitive data unintentionally

### Common Security Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't log sensitive user data
- Validate all import data before processing
- Sanitize user input in character/faction names
- Handle AsyncStorage errors gracefully

## Common Pitfalls & Gotchas

### React Native / Expo Specific

- **AsyncStorage is asynchronous** - always await operations
- **Navigation state** - use `useFocusEffect` for screen-specific logic
- **Image URIs** - handle both local and remote image sources
- **Platform differences** - test Android-specific features on Android
- **Expo Go limitations** - some features require custom dev builds

### TypeScript Issues

- Path aliases require proper tsconfig.json configuration
- Strict mode catches many runtime errors at compile time
- Some TypeScript errors exist but don't prevent builds
- Use proper types instead of `any` to catch bugs early

### Data Management

- **Faction sync** - character changes must update faction member lists
- **Relationship bidirectionality** - ensure relationships update both ways
- **AsyncStorage size limits** - large datasets may need chunking
- **Import/Export edge cases** - handle malformed CSV/JSON gracefully
- **Date handling** - be consistent with date formats across the app

### Development Workflow

- **Pre-commit hooks** can fail silently - check output
- **Metro bundler cache** - clear cache if strange errors occur: `npx expo start -c`
- **Node modules** - occasionally need to delete and reinstall
- **Husky hooks** - require `npm run prepare` after fresh clone

## For AI Coding Assistants

### General Guidelines

When making changes to this codebase:

1. **Always** run linting and type-checking before committing
2. **Maintain** the existing dark theme and design patterns
3. **Follow** the established project structure
4. **Use** existing utility functions rather than duplicating logic
5. **Test** changes on Android (preferred) or web
6. **Document** any new features or significant changes
7. **Keep** component files focused and single-responsibility
8. **Respect** the path alias system defined in tsconfig.json
9. **Avoid** breaking changes to data storage format
10. **Check** that pre-commit hooks pass

### Best Task Types for AI Assistance

**Well-suited tasks:**

- Bug fixes in specific components or utilities
- Adding new UI components following existing patterns
- Refactoring code to improve readability or performance
- Adding or updating documentation
- Implementing new screens following existing screen patterns
- Data model updates and storage migrations
- CSV import/export enhancements
- Analytics and reporting features

**Challenging tasks (approach with caution):**

- Major navigation restructuring
- Core data storage architecture changes
- Complex state management refactoring
- Platform-specific native module integration
- Performance optimization requiring profiling
- Security-sensitive authentication/authorization changes

### Code Review Expectations

**Before submitting changes:**

- Run `npm run check-all` and fix all errors
- Test on Android device or emulator
- Verify no breaking changes to existing features
- Check that data persists correctly
- Ensure navigation flows work as expected
- Review diffs to confirm only intended changes

**Quality standards:**

- All TypeScript code must type-check (use `npm run type-check`)
- ESLint must pass without errors (warnings acceptable)
- Code must be formatted with Prettier
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Add comments for complex logic only
- Keep functions small and focused

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Errors

**"Cannot find module" errors:**

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Metro bundler issues:**

```bash
npx expo start -c  # Clear cache
```

**TypeScript errors after changes:**

```bash
npm run type-check  # Check all errors
npx tsc --noEmit    # Alternative checker
```

### Runtime Errors

**AsyncStorage errors:**

- Check device storage space
- Verify JSON serialization of data
- Ensure all async operations are awaited

**Navigation errors:**

- Verify screen names match navigation types
- Check that navigation params are properly typed
- Ensure React Navigation is properly configured

**Image loading failures:**

- Verify image URIs are valid
- Check Expo Image Picker permissions
- Handle both local and remote image sources

### Development Environment

**Expo Go won't connect:**

- Ensure device and computer are on same network
- Check firewall settings
- Try `npx expo start --tunnel` for alternative connection

**Android build fails:**

- Verify `eas.json` configuration
- Check Expo account has build quota
- Review EAS build logs for specific errors

**Pre-commit hooks not running:**

```bash
npm run prepare      # Reinstall Husky hooks
chmod +x .husky/*    # Ensure hooks are executable
```
